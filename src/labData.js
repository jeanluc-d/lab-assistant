Fatigue and tiredness are not indications for vitamin B12, folate or ferritin measurement. 3. Vitamin B12, folate and ferritin testing should not be measured as part of a general health screen. 4. Patients who are pregnant/taking an oral contraceptive pill/taking Metformin can have falsely low vitamin B12 levels. 5. Vitamin B12 stores last over three years. Therefore, if a normal vitamin B12 result has been obtained in the previous six months, a further vitamin B12 test will not be processed unless discussed with a haematology consultant. 6. Folate stores last for a shorter period of time. Therefore, repeat folate testing may be necessary if one of the indications below is met. 7. Patients on parenteral vitamin B12 replacement therapy do not require repeat vitamin B12 measurement unless blood counts or neurological symptoms fail to improve. 8. Patients on folic acid replacement therapy do not require repeat folate measurement unless blood counts fail to improve. 9. The minimum interval for repeat testing of vitamin B12 and folate is generally 90 days. However, if appropriate new clinic details are provided, retesting may be performed within 90 days.

Do not use existing peripheral lines/cannulae or sites immediately above peripheral lines. (If a central line is present, blood may be taken from this and from a separate peripheral site when investigating potential infection related to the central line; the peripheral vein sample should be collected first.) Identify a suitable venepuncture site before disinfecting the skin. Avoid femoral vein puncture because of the difficulty in adequate skin cleansing and disinfection.  Thoroughly disinfect the skin before inserting the needle Thoroughly cleanse the patient’s skin before venepuncture. Use soap and water to clean visibly soiled skin and then clean your own hands. Use a 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol impregnated swab to disinfect the patient’s skin and allow to dry.  Once disinfected, don’t touch the skin again To avoid cross-contamination from the collector’s fingers (even when gloved), it is vitally important not to palpate the site again once it has been disinfected.  Disinfect the culture bottle cap before transferring the sample Ideally, remove the plastic cover immediately before collecting the sample; the top of the bottle will be clean but not sterile. Disinfect the tops of the culture bottles with a 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol impregnated swab. Allow the alcohol to fully evaporate before proceeding with bottle inoculation.",

Number and time of collection – General guide Suspected sepsis or acute septic shock. In cases of suspected sepsis or acute septic shock or in individuals with any prosthetic material in situ (valve, hip etc), collect 2-3 separate venepunctures (two bottles each) immediately before starting treatment. Suspected line sepsis Please ensure that a blood culture set is taken both peripherally and from the suspected line. Infective endocarditis (IE) or chronically ill patients In suspected Infective endocarditis (IE) or chronically ill patients, obtain three blood culture sets during the first 1-2 hours of evaluation; if all are sterile 24 hours later, obtain three more sets. From patients who have received antimicrobial agents within two weeks prior to admission, obtain two separate blood cultures on each of three successive days. Suspected bacteremia For suspected bacteremia in patients already on antimicrobial therapy, if therapy cannot be suspended for a few days, draw 2-3 cultures within the first 48 hours. Cultures should be taken immediately before the next dose of antimicrobial agent if the patient is receiving intermittent parenteral therapy. Pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) For fever of unknown origin (e.g., occult abscess, typhoid fever, or brucellosis), obtain two or three blood cultures initially. Then 24-36 hours later, obtain two more cultures immediately before the expected (usually afternoon) temperature elevation. Sepsis of the newborn One to two blood cultures usually suffice for diagnosing sepsis of the newborn. The physician should determine the volume of blood. Inject 1-2mL into a paediatric bottle. Blood culture for Mycobacterium sp. Please refer to the TB section in this manual. 5. Incubation Routine blood cultures are incubated for five days, unless the lab is notified to hold for a longer period (e.g., when IE, brucellosis or systemic fungal infections such as histoplasmosis are suspected). The routine 5-day incubation period is adequate for recovery of most yeasts (e.g., Candida species).",

Prior cleaning is essential if greasy ointments or powders have been applied to the region. Scalp Specimens from the scalp are best obtained by scraping with a blunt scalpel. The contents should include hair stubs, the contents of plugged follicles and skin scales. Hair may also be plucked from the scalp with forceps (infected hairs are usually easy to remove in this way). Cut hairs are unsatisfactory as the focus of infection is usually below or near the surface of the scalp. Nail clippings Nail clippings should be taken from any discoloured, dystrophic or brittle parts of the nail. These should be cut as far back as possible from the free edge of the nail and include its full thickness, scrapings can also be taken from beneath the nail to supplement the clipping sample. Skin Skin samples should be collected by scraping outwards from the edges of the lesions, with either a blunt scalpel blade or with the edge of a glass microscope slide.

The total children's dose should not exceed 75g.  Each 300mL pouch of Rapilose® OGTT Solution contains exactly 75g anhydrous glucose, which is the adult dose recommended by the World Health Organisation.  Rapilose® OGTT Solution is produced in a ready to drink format in a 300mL aluminium foil pouch with a tamper evident twist off cap.  Rapilose® OGTT Solution is a pleasant tasting orange flavoured drink that is non-carbonated and contains no colour additives. It is also gluten, lactose, fat, caffeine and alcohol free.  Rapilose® OGTT Solution has an 18 month shelf-life, when stored unopened at room temperature",

Mitogen Control (Violet cap) Contact the clinical microbiology laboratory at Ext 2255 for same Specimen collection For each patient collect 1ml of blood by venepuncture directly into each of the Quantiferon-TB Gold IT blood collection tubes. Blood should be collected into the Nil tube (Grey) first then the TB1 Antigen tube (green), followed by the TB2 (yellow) & finally the Mitogen tube (Violet). As 1ml tubes draw blood relatively slowly, keep the tube on the needle for 2-3 seconds once the tube appears to have completed filling, to ensure that the correct volume is drawn. The black mark on the side of the tubes indicates the 1ml fill volume. If a butterfly needle is being used to collect blood a purge tube should be used to ensure that the tubing is filled with blood prior to the Quantiferon-TB Gold tubes being used. Antigens have been dried onto the inner wall of the blood collection tubes so it is essential that the contents of the tubes be thoroughly mixed with the blood. Mix the tubes by turning the tube end-over-end 8-10 times or shaking the tubes for 5 seconds ensuring that the entire inner surface of the tube has been coated with the blood. Label tubes & the designated quantiferon request form noting date & time sample taken. The tubes must be transferred to a 37°C incubator as soon as possible. Do not refrigerate or freeze the samples prior to incubation. Any queries regarding the collection and transport of samples please phone the Microbiology Laboratory @ 061- 482843 / 482842",

General principles 1. Measurement of vitamin B12, folate or ferritin should only be performed following clinical assessment, and in the presence of one of the specific indications listed below. 2. Fatigue and tiredness are not indications for vitamin B12, folate or ferritin measurement. 3. Vitamin B12, folate and ferritin testing should not be measured as part of a general health screen. 4. Patients who are pregnant/taking an oral contraceptive pill/taking Metformin can have falsely low vitamin B12 levels. 5. Vitamin B12 stores last over three years. Therefore, if a normal vitamin B12 result has been obtained in the previous six months, a further vitamin B12 test will not be processed unless discussed with a haematology consultant. 6. Folate stores last for a shorter period of time. Therefore, repeat folate testing may be necessary if one of the indications below is met. 7. Patients on parenteral vitamin B12 replacement therapy do not require repeat vitamin B12 measurement unless blood counts or neurological symptoms fail to improve. 8. Patients on folic acid replacement therapy do not require repeat folate measurement unless blood counts fail to improve. 9. The minimum interval for repeat testing of vitamin B12 and folate is generally 90 days. However, if appropriate new clinic details are provided, retesting may be performed within 90 days.
